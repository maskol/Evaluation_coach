PI OBJECTIVES TEMPLATE – SAFe
==============================

Purpose:
PI Objectives describe the key business and technical outcomes that a team or ART
plans to achieve during a Program Increment (PI).

PI Objectives:
- Focus on outcomes, not tasks or detailed feature lists
- Provide alignment between strategy, Epics, Features, and delivery
- Enable business and technical stakeholders to understand what value will be delivered
- Support confidence-based planning and dependency management

This template is designed for a 13-week PI with 2-week iterations.

------------------------------------------------
5. PI OBJECTIVES (OUTCOME-FOCUSED)
------------------------------------------------
Define 3–7 objectives that describe *what will be achieved*, not *what will be built*.

Guidelines:
- Each objective should express customer or business value
- Objectives may span multiple iterations
- Use measurable language where possible
- Avoid listing features or technical tasks directly

Objective 1:
[Describe the outcome to be achieved]

Business Value (1–10):
[Assigned collaboratively with Business Owners]

------------------------------------------------
Objective 2:
[Describe the outcome to be achieved]

Business Value (1–10):
[Fill in here]

------------------------------------------------
Objective 3:

Business Value (1–10):
[Fill in here]

------------------------------------------------
(Optional additional objectives)

------------------------------------------------
6. STRETCH OBJECTIVES (OPTIONAL)
------------------------------------------------
Stretch objectives are desirable but not committed.

Stretch Objective:

------------------------------------------------
7. MEASUREMENT & SUCCESS CRITERIA
------------------------------------------------
How will we know each PI Objective has been achieved?

For each objective, define:
- Success criteria
- Measurable indicators

Example:
- Adoption rate reaches X%
- Cycle time reduced from X to Y
- Error rate below X%
