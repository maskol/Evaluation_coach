STRATEGIC INITIATIVE TEMPLATE
==============================

Purpose:
A Strategic Initiative describes a significant business or customer problem
that the organization wants to solve. It provides direction and intent,
not a predefined solution.

This template is designed for discovery:
- It guides thinking before Epics are created
- It focuses on outcomes over outputs
- It supports validation of Desirability, Usability, Feasibility, and Viability

A Strategic Initiative typically results in:
- One or more Epics
- Clear success criteria
- A shared understanding of the problem and desired impact

5. ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS (WHY)
------------------------------------------------
Why do we believe this problem exists?

Consider:
- Process issues
- Organizational constraints
- Technology limitations
- Policy or governance factors
- Incorrect assumptions

This is a hypothesis, not a conclusion.

[Fill in here]

------------------------------------------------
9. PRODUCT DISCOVERY – DVFU CHECK
------------------------------------------------
Evaluate the four key risks:

DESIRABILITY (Value Risk):
- Why do we believe customers want this?
- What evidence do we have today?

[Fill in here]

USABILITY (Usability Risk):
- How will users interact with this?
- What usability risks do we foresee?

[Fill in here]

FEASIBILITY (Feasibility Risk):
- Can we build this with current skills, systems, and time?
- What technical unknowns exist?

[Fill in here]

VIABILITY (Business Risk):
- Does this work financially?
- Any legal, regulatory, brand, or operational constraints?

[Fill in here]

------------------------------------------------
10. DISCOVERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------
How will we validate the assumptions and risks above?

Examples:
- Customer interviews
- Prototypes or mockups
- Technical spikes
- Data analysis
- Experiments / pilots

12. MILESTONES
------------------------------------------------
What are the key milestones and timeline for this initiative?

Define major checkpoints and time boundaries:

MILESTONE 1:
Description: [e.g., Discovery phase complete]
Target Date: [e.g., Q1 2026]
Success Criteria: [What must be achieved]

MILESTONE 2:
Description: [e.g., MVP validated with customers]
Target Date: [e.g., Q2 2026]
Success Criteria: [What must be achieved]

MILESTONE 3:
Description: [e.g., Full deployment to pilot group]
Target Date: [e.g., Q3 2026]
Success Criteria: [What must be achieved]

MILESTONE 4:
Description: [e.g., Scale to all customers]
Target Date: [e.g., Q4 2026]
Success Criteria: [What must be achieved]

Notes:
- Keep milestones realistic and measurable
- Each milestone should demonstrate value or learning
- Allow for pivots based on discovery outcomes
