LEAN BUSINESS CASE TEMPLATE
===========================================
Purpose:
This template provides a structured approach to creating a Lean Business Case for SAFe Epics.
It focuses on hypothesis-driven development, incremental implementation, and measurable outcomes.

===========================================
SECTION 1: EPIC OVERVIEW
===========================================

Epic Owner:
[Who is the epic owner? Include name and role]

Key Stakeholders:
[List the names and roles of key stakeholders who will be involved in or affected by this epic]

Epic Description:
[Consider using the epic Hypothesis Statement from the epic article as a starting point. Describe what this epic is about, the problem it solves, and the value it delivers. Keep it concise and outcome-focused.]

===========================================
SECTION 2: BUSINESS OUTCOMES & METRICS
===========================================

Business Outcome Hypothesis:
[Describe how the success of the epic will be measured. Use specific, measurable outcomes.
Examples:
- 50% increase in shoppers under age 25
- Availability increases from 95% to 99.7%
- Customer satisfaction score increases from 7.5 to 8.5
- Processing time reduced from 5 days to 2 days]

Leading Indicators:
[Establish innovation accounting metrics to provide early signals of the outcomes hypothesis.
Examples:
- Measurable change in purchaser demographics within 30 days of feature release
- 20% increase in feature adoption within first month
- 15% reduction in support tickets within 60 days
- User engagement metrics show 30% improvement in first quarter]

===========================================
SECTION 3: SCOPE DEFINITION
===========================================

In Scope:
* [List specific capabilities, features, or work that IS included in this epic]
* [Be specific about what will be delivered]
* [Focus on outcomes and value, not detailed implementation]

Out of Scope:
* [List specific capabilities, features, or work that is NOT included in this epic]
* [Clarify boundaries to avoid scope creep]
* [Note items that may be addressed in future epics]

Nonfunctional Requirements:
* [Performance requirements - response times, throughput, capacity]
* [Security and compliance requirements]
* [Scalability, availability, and reliability requirements]
* [Usability and accessibility requirements]
* [Integration and compatibility requirements]

===========================================
SECTION 4: MVP & FEATURES
===========================================

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features:
* [Feature or Capability 1 - Core functionality needed to test the hypothesis]
* [Feature or Capability 2 - Essential features for minimum value delivery]
* [Feature or Capability 3 - Critical components for validating the business outcome]

Additional Potential Features:
* [Feature or Capability 1 - Enhancements to consider after MVP validation]
* [Feature or Capability 2 - Nice-to-have features that add incremental value]
* [Feature or Capability 3 - Future capabilities based on MVP learnings]

===========================================
SECTION 5: ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATION
===========================================

Analysis Summary:
[Provide a brief summary of the analysis that has been performed to create this business case.
Include:
- Market research or customer feedback reviewed
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Competitive analysis
- Risk assessment
- Key assumptions]

Go / No-Go Recommendation:
[Clearly state Go or No-Go recommendation with supporting rationale]

===========================================
SECTION 6: SOLUTION ANALYSIS
===========================================

Internal and External Customer Impact:
[Describe the user community and markets affected.
Address:
- Which customer segments are impacted?
- How will their experience change?
- What benefits will they receive?
- Any potential disruption or change management needed?]

Impact on Solutions, Programs, and Services:
[Identify solutions, programs, services, teams, and departments that may be impacted by this epic.
Consider:
- System integrations and dependencies
- Operational changes required
- Training and support needs
- Process changes]

Impact on Sales, Distribution, Deployment, and Support:
[For external solutions or products, describe potential impact on:
- Sales processes and messaging
- Distribution channels
- Deployment and onboarding
- Customer support and documentation
- Marketing and communication]

===========================================
SECTION 7: FORECASTED COSTS
===========================================

MVP Cost:
[What is the investment requested to fund the MVP?
Include:
- Development and testing costs
- Infrastructure and tools
- Training and documentation
- Estimated timeframe]

Estimated Implementation Cost:
[What is the estimated investment (cost) of full implementation if the MVP hypothesis is proven true?
Note: This estimate is refined over time based on learnings]

Initial Estimate:
[Express as a range with assumptions - Example: $200K - $350K for 6-9 months of development]

Refined Estimate(s):
[As experiments are run and learnings are gained, update the estimate here:
- Date: [Date]
- Updated Estimate: [Amount]
- Rationale: [What changed and why]]

===========================================
SECTION 8: FORECASTED RETURNS
===========================================

Type of Return:
[Identify the primary type(s) of return expected:
- Increased revenue
- Market share growth
- Improved productivity/efficiency
- Cost reduction
- New markets served
- Customer retention/satisfaction
- Risk mitigation
- Competitive advantage]

Quantified Return Projection:
[Provide specific projections where possible:
- Revenue impact: [Amount per year]
- Cost savings: [Amount per year]
- Efficiency gains: [Percentage or time saved]
- Market opportunity: [Size and capture potential]
- ROI projection: [Return on Investment estimate]
- Payback period: [Expected time to recoup investment]]

===========================================
SECTION 9: DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
===========================================

In-house or Outsourced Development:
[Provide recommendations for where and how the epic should be developed.
Consider:
- Strategic importance (core vs. non-core)
- Internal capability and capacity
- Speed to market requirements
- Cost considerations
- IP and security concerns
- Recommended approach with rationale]

Incremental Implementation Strategy:
[Epics are defined as a single whole but undergo incremental implementation.
Describe the strategy:
- How will the epic be broken down into releases?
- What is the learning and validation approach?
- How will feedback be incorporated?
- What are the key milestones and decision points?]

Sequencing and Dependencies:
[Describe constraints and dependencies:
- Prerequisites that must be completed first
- Dependencies on other epics or solutions
- Resource constraints or timing considerations
- External dependencies (vendors, partners, compliance)
- Recommended sequencing with rationale]

===========================================
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE
===========================================

Tips for Success:
1. Focus on outcomes, not outputs
2. Keep hypotheses testable and measurable
3. Start small with MVP, learn, and iterate
4. Update estimates as you learn
5. Engage stakeholders early and often
6. Consider both value and cost of delay
7. Document assumptions and validate them
8. Plan for change management and adoption

Key Questions to Answer:
- What problem are we solving and for whom?
- How will we know if we're successful?
- What's the smallest thing we can build to test our hypothesis?
- What are the risks and how will we mitigate them?
- What dependencies must we manage?
- What's the expected return on investment?
