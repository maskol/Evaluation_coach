EPIC TEMPLATE – SAFe EPIC HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT
------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
Use this template to describe Epics in a consistent way. Focus on the problem,
business outcome, customer value, and the hypothesis — not detailed solution design.

Guidance:
- Keep the writing concise and outcome-focused.
- Each field should be 1–5 sentences.
- Think “hypothesis” — expect refinement as you learn.

EXAMPLE (SIMPLE, FICTIONAL)
------------------------------------------------
EPIC NAME:
Reduce Time-to-Market for New B2B Services

EPIC OWNER:
Anna Svensson, Epic Owner B2B Portfolio

BUSINESS CONTEXT / BACKGROUND:
It currently takes 9–12 months to launch new B2B services. Competitors move
faster, resulting in lost business and reduced competitiveness.

PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY:
B2B customers perceive us as slow. Internally, there are many handovers,
manual coordination steps, and unclear responsibilities.

TARGET CUSTOMERS / USERS:
- External mid-market B2B customers
- Internal sales and product management teams

EPIC HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT:
For B2B sales and product teams
who spend 9-12 months launching new services due to fragmented processes
the Time-to-Market Acceleration Epic
is a standardized value stream with clear ownership and reduced handovers
that enables launches in under 7 months
unlike our current ad-hoc approach with multiple disconnected teams
our solution significantly improves competitiveness and unlocks new revenue opportunities
by allowing us to launch twice as many services with better quality

DESIRED BUSINESS OUTCOMES:
- Reduce average time-to-market from ~10 months to <7 months
- Increase number of new B2B offers from 4 to 7 per year
- Improve win-rate by 10 percentage points

LEADING INDICATORS:
- Number of initiatives using the new standardized flow
- Number of handovers per initiative
- Cycle time per step

MVP (MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT):
MVP FEATURES:
- Document and map current B2B service launch process for 2 representative services
- Identify top 3 bottlenecks and design streamlined flow
- Pilot new flow with 1-2 new service launches

MVP SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Reduce time-to-market by at least 20% for pilot services
- Achieve 80% satisfaction score from pilot teams
- Identify and document minimum 5 process improvements

MVP TIMELINE:
3 months (Q1 2026)

MVP TARGET USERS:
- 2 B2B product teams launching new services in Q1
- Sales enablement team

FORECASTED FULL SCOPE:
FULL CAPABILITIES:
- Standardized end-to-end launch process across all B2B services

- Self-service launch portal for product teams
- Integrated measurement dashboard

FULL ROLLOUT PLAN:
- Phase 1 (MVP): 1-2 pilot services - Q1 2026
- Phase 2: Expand to 5 additional services - Q2 2026
- Phase 3: Full rollout to all B2B product teams - Q3-Q4 2026

ESTIMATED TIMELINE:
12 months from MVP start to full implementation

EXPECTED BENEFITS AT FULL SCALE:
- Consistent <7 month time-to-market for all B2B services
- 7+ new services launched per year (vs. current 4)
- 15% improvement in win-rate
- 30% reduction in coordination overhead

FORECASTED COSTS:
MVP COST:
- Development and design: $80K - $100K
- Pilot support and training: $20K - $30K
- Tools and infrastructure: $15K - $25K
- Total MVP investment: $115K - $155K over 3 months

ESTIMATED FULL IMPLEMENTATION COST:
Initial Estimate: $350K - $500K for 12 months
- Includes workflow automation tools, portal development, training programs, and change management
- Assumes 2-3 dedicated team members plus SME support

SCOPE / OUT OF SCOPE:
IN SCOPE:
- Analysis of current B2B service-delivery flows
- Design of standardized launch flow(s)
- Alignment between business and IT

OUT OF SCOPE:
- Large-scale system modernization
- Pricing model changes

NONFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

BUSINESS IMPACT & VALUE ASSUMPTIONS:
Faster time-to-market unlocks new revenue opportunities and reduces
coordination cost.

TYPE OF RETURN:
- Increased revenue (faster market entry)
- Improved productivity/efficiency
- Competitive advantage
- Market share growth

QUANTIFIED RETURN PROJECTION:
- Revenue impact: $2M - $3M additional annual revenue from 3 extra service launches
- Cost savings: $150K per year in reduced coordination overhead
- Efficiency gains: 30% reduction in launch cycle time
- ROI projection: 250% - 350% over 3 years
- Payback period: 8-10 months

SOLUTION ANALYSIS:
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CUSTOMER IMPACT:
- Mid-market B2B customers benefit from faster access to innovative services
- Sales teams can respond more quickly to market demands
- Product teams gain clarity and reduced frustration in launch process
- Minimal disruption expected as new process is opt-in during pilot

IMPACT ON SOLUTIONS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES:
- Integration with existing CRM (Salesforce) and project tools (Jira)
- Marketing team needs new templates and communication processes
- Finance requires updated approval workflows for faster cycles
- Training program for 15-20 product managers and sales enablement staff

IMPACT ON SALES, DISTRIBUTION, DEPLOYMENT, AND SUPPORT:
- Sales enablement receives structured playbooks 2-3 months earlier
- Distribution channels benefit from more frequent, smaller releases
- Support team needs updated documentation process to match faster cycles
- Marketing communications streamlined with standard launch templates

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY:
IN-HOUSE OR OUTSOURCED DEVELOPMENT:
Recommendation: Primarily in-house with selective external support
- Core process design and workflow automation: In-house (strategic capability)
- Portal UI/UX development: Partner with external agency (speed and expertise)
- Change management and training: In-house with external coaching support
Rationale: Process knowledge is strategic IP; external partners accelerate technical delivery

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
- Release 1 (MVP): Pilot with 2 services, manual workflow, documented process
- Release 2: Add 5 more services, introduce workflow tracking tool
- Release 3: Deploy self-service portal for all teams
- Release 4: Full automation and integration with enterprise systems
Key decision point after MVP: If time-to-market doesn't improve by 20%, reassess approach

SEQUENCING AND DEPENDENCIES:
Prerequisites:
- Executive sponsorship secured (Month 0)
- 2 pilot product teams identified and committed (Month 0)
Dependencies:
- CRM integration requires IT platform team (3-week lead time)
- Marketing template library must be completed before Phase 2
External dependencies:
- UI/UX agency contract and onboarding (4-6 weeks)
Recommended sequencing: MVP → Process validation → Tool selection → Automation → Scale

RISKS, ASSUMPTIONS & CONSTRAINTS:
ASSUMPTIONS:
- Business stakeholders will adopt new ways of working.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Limited availability of key SMEs during Q2–Q3.

KEY RISKS:
- Resistance to change
- Underestimation of complexity

WSJF – HIGH LEVEL:
BUSINESS / USER VALUE: 18
TIME CRITICALITY: 15
RISK REDUCTION: 13
JOB SIZE: 8

METRICS & MEASUREMENT PLAN:
