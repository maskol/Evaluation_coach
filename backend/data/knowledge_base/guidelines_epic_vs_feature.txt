GUIDELINES: EPIC VS FEATURE (SAFe)
===================================

Purpose:
This document helps Epic Owners, Product Managers, and AI assistants distinguish
between Epics and Features in a SAFe context. It provides clear definitions,
patterns, anti-patterns, and decision rules.

------------------------------------------------
1. DEFINITIONS
------------------------------------------------

EPIC:
- A large cross-cutting initiative requiring significant investment and analysis.
- A hypothesis for business value and solution direction.
- Typically spans multiple PIs.
- Requires a Lean Business Case (Epic Hypothesis Statement).
- Approved by Portfolio or Solution level.
- Often includes multiple capabilities or features.

FEATURE:
- A service, capability, or function that delivers measurable value.
- Small enough to be completed within a PI by a single Agile Release Train.
- Has a clear Benefit Hypothesis and Acceptance Criteria.
- Implements part of an Epic (but can also originate independently).
- Often the smallest backlog item needed to deliver customer value at scale.

------------------------------------------------
2. QUICK DIFFERENCES
------------------------------------------------

SCOPE:
- Epic → big, cross-team, multi-quarter  
- Feature → specific capability, 1–2 PIs

VALUE:
- Epic → strategic, large-scale business impact  
- Feature → direct customer or system behavior

RISK:
- Epic → high uncertainty, needs analysis  
- Feature → low to medium, ready for implementation

DECISION LEVEL:
- Epic → portfolio/solution level  
- Feature → program level

ART INVOLVEMENT:
- Epic → involves multiple ARTs or major coordination  
- Feature → typically 1 ART (sometimes 2)

------------------------------------------------
3. WHEN TO CHOOSE AN EPIC
------------------------------------------------
Choose EPIC if:

- The initiative requires coordination across several value streams or ARTs.
- It addresses a major strategic theme or objective.
- Investment exceeds threshold (budget or capacity).
- Solution direction is unknown and needs analysis/spikes.
- Lead time is > 1 PI.
- It changes business processes, operating models, or architecture significantly.
- It delivers multiple capabilities or features.

Examples:
- Introduce a new product line (e.g., SaaS security platform).
- Modernize core telecom provisioning systems.
- Establish a new onboarding experience across channels.
- Introduce enterprise-wide identity & access management.

------------------------------------------------
4. WHEN TO CHOOSE A FEATURE
------------------------------------------------
Choose FEATURE if:

- It can be delivered by one ART (or at most coordinated between two).
- Clear definition of done exists.
- It provides a discrete increment of value.
- It is part of an Epic’s scope OR stands alone but is still small enough.
- Lead time fits within one PI or less.

Examples:
- Add automated SIM activation validation.
- Enable self-service number porting.
- Expose SLA reporting API for enterprise customers.
- Introduce new workflow for B2B service launch.

------------------------------------------------
5. COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS
------------------------------------------------

ANTI-PATTERN 1: Calling everything an Epic  
→ Leads to slow decision cycles, unnecessary approval overhead.

ANTI-PATTERN 2: Using Features as task lists  
→ A Feature is NOT a set of technical tasks.

ANTI-PATTERN 3: Very big Features  
→ A Feature that spans multiple PIs or multiple ARTs → should be an Epic.

ANTI-PATTERN 4: Epics described as technical upgrades  
→ Epics should communicate business value.

------------------------------------------------
6. RULE OF THUMB
------------------------------------------------

Ask:
“If we deliver this in one PI with one ART, and it has clear acceptance criteria,
is it still too big?”  
→ If yes = Epic. If no = Feature.

Another:
“If successful, does this fundamentally change customer experience,
operating model, or major business KPIs?”  
→ If yes = Epic.

------------------------------------------------
7. TELECOM-SPECIFIC INDICATORS
------------------------------------------------

Epic Indicators:
- Impacts provisioning, billing, catalog, CRM, and customer portals.
- Introduces a new commercial capability (e.g., IoT platform).
- Requires regulatory or compliance-wide change (e.g., eSIM onboarding flow).
- Impacts many customer journeys (acquisition, onboarding, support).

Feature Indicators:
- Adds a new capability to a service (e.g., new bundle logic).
- Automates existing steps in provisioning.
- Introduces a new reporting dashboard for B2B customers.
- Migrates one specific component or API.

8. DECISION TABLE (RAG-FRIENDLY)
------------------------------------------------

| Criterion                         | Epic                         | Feature                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Delivery time                    | Multi-PI, multi-quarter     | 1 PI or less                    |
| Investment level                 | High                         | Moderate/low                     |
| ART involvement                  | Multiple                     | One (usually)                    |
| Uncertainty                      | High                         | Low/medium                       |
| Requires business case           | Yes                          | No                               |
| Value type                       | Strategic                    | Incremental                      |
| Breakdown                        | To capabilities & features   | To stories                       |
| Approval                         | Portfolio/Solution           | Program (PO/PM)                  |

9. AI ASSISTANT GUIDANCE (for your RAG agent)
------------------------------------------------
When the user posts text:
- If it describes a problem, opportunity, strategic need → classify as Epic.
- If it describes a concrete capability with acceptance criteria → classify as Feature.
- If it is too vague, ask clarifying questions.
