USER STORY TEMPLATE – Agile User Story
---------------------------------------
Purpose:
Use this template to describe User Stories that deliver small increments of 
value. User Stories are the building blocks of Features and should be 
completable within a single sprint (1-2 weeks).

Guidance:
- Follow the "As a... I want... So that..." format
- Keep stories small and focused on user value
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Stories should be independently deliverable when possible

EXAMPLE (SIMPLE, FICTIONAL)
--------------------------------------------
USER STORY TITLE:
View Connection Quality Dashboard

USER STORY STATEMENT:
As a network administrator
I want to view a real-time dashboard of connection quality metrics
So that I can quickly identify and respond to connectivity issues

STORY DESCRIPTION:
What:
A web-based dashboard that displays key connection quality metrics including 
latency, packet loss, and bandwidth utilization for all active connections.

Why:
Network administrators need quick visibility into connection health to 
proactively address issues before they impact customers.
