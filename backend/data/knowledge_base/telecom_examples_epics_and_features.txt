TELECOM EXAMPLES – EPICS AND FEATURES
======================================

This document provides anonymized, realistic telecom examples for SAFe Epic and
Feature creation: B2B, B2C, network, provisioning, catalog, onboarding, and billing.

------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: TELECOM EPIC EXAMPLES
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
EPIC EXAMPLE A: Unified B2B Onboarding Experience
------------------------------------------------
EPIC NAME:
Unified B2B Customer Onboarding Experience

EPIC OWNER:
Head of B2B Digital Transformation

PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY:
B2B customers experience long onboarding times (10–30 days) due to manual
identity checks, provisioning delays, and disconnected tools.

TARGET CUSTOMERS:
Medium and large enterprise customers purchasing connectivity and managed services.

HYPOTHESIS:
We believe that by introducing a unified digital onboarding flow across sales,
catalog, provisioning, and billing, we will reduce onboarding time by 40%
and improve NPS for new customers by 15 points.

DESIRED BUSINESS OUTCOMES:
- Reduce onboarding lead time from 15 days to <7 days.
- Reduce manual coordination workload by 50%.
- Increase win rate in strategic segments by 8%.

------------------------------------------------
EPIC EXAMPLE B: Migration to Cloud-Native Provisioning
------------------------------------------------
EPIC NAME:
Cloud-Native Provisioning Modernization

PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY:
Legacy provisioning systems cause high failure rates, long cycle times,
and limit new product introductions.

HYPOTHESIS:
Modernizing provisioning to cloud-native microservices will reduce failures,
enable real-time activation, and support 5G/IoT services.

BUSINESS OUTCOMES:
- Reduce provisioning failures from 12% to <3%.
- Enable same-day activation for 90% of services.
- Reduce operational cost by 20%.

------------------------------------------------
EPIC EXAMPLE C: New IoT Device Management Platform
------------------------------------------------
EPIC NAME:
IoT Device Lifecycle Management Platform

PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY:
Enterprise customers require large-scale SIM and device management with automation.

BUSINESS OUTCOMES:
- Unlock new revenue streams in IoT.
- Reduce manual overhead for enterprise customers.

LEADING INDICATORS:
- Active IoT connections
- Automated provisioning steps

------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: TELECOM FEATURE EXAMPLES

------------------------------------------------
FEATURE EXAMPLE 1: Automated SIM Activation Validation
------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
Introduce automated validation checks for SIM activation (identity, eligibility,
credit profile). Replaces manual back-office validation.

BENEFIT HYPOTHESIS:
We believe this will reduce activation errors and cut activation time by 60%.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- AC1: SIM activation requests are automatically validated using internal rules.
- AC2: Failed validation triggers customer notification with recommended actions.
- AC3: Validation logs are available to customer support.

------------------------------------------------
FEATURE EXAMPLE 2: Enterprise SLA Reporting API
------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
Expose real-time SLA metrics (latency, uptime, ticket status) through a secure
API for enterprise customers.

BENEFIT HYPOTHESIS:
Improves transparency and reduces incoming support tickets.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- AC1: Enterprise customers can retrieve SLA metrics via API.
- AC2: API enforces authentication via OAuth2.
- AC3: Data refresh rate <5 minutes.

------------------------------------------------
FEATURE EXAMPLE 3: Self-Service Number Porting
------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
Enable customers to request number porting through the digital portal, with
automated validation and status tracking.

BENEFIT HYPOTHESIS:
Reduce customer support load and speed up porting.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- AC1: Customer can submit porting request digitally.
- AC2: Customer can track porting status in real time.
- AC3: Failed ports generate actionable error messages.

------------------------------------------------
FEATURE EXAMPLE 4: Catalog-Driven Product Bundling
------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
Allow product managers to configure B2B and B2C bundles using existing catalog
components without code changes.

BENEFIT HYPOTHESIS:
Reduces time-to-market for new offers and improves configurability.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- AC1: PM can create bundles consisting of existing catalog items.
- AC2: Bundle propagation to provisioning and billing is automatic.
- AC3: Incorrect configurations generate validation errors.

------------------------------------------------
FEATURE EXAMPLE 5: Real-Time Provisioning Dashboard
------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
Provide real-time monitoring of provisioning status (pending, failed, completed)
for back-office and ops teams.

BENEFIT HYPOTHESIS:
Reduces time-to-resolution for provisioning errors.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- AC1: Dashboard shows status of provisioning steps with timestamps.
- AC2: Errors include detailed error codes and recommended actions.
- AC3: Filtering by product, customer type, and channel is supported.
