FEATURE TEMPLATE – SAFe FEATURE DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------
Purpose:
Use this template to describe Features at the program level. A Feature should
deliver clear customer/business value and be small enough to complete within
a PI (or less).

Guidance:
- A Feature is not a technical task.
- Focus on value, capability, and the outcome delivered.
- Acceptance criteria should be testable and outcome-oriented.

IMPORTANT - FEATURE SELECTION PROCESS:
When breaking down an Epic into multiple MVP features:
1. Present the list of 3-5 proposed features to the user
2. ASK the user which feature they want to draft first
3. WAIT for the user to select a specific feature
4. Only then draft the selected feature in detail

DO NOT automatically draft the first feature without user selection.
The user should choose which feature is most important to detail first.
