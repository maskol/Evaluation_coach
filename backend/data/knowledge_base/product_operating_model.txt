PRODUCT OPERATING MODEL (DISCOVERY + DELIVERY)
============================================================

Purpose:
Provide guidance for empowered product teams working in a modern product model.
Validates that solutions are Desirable, Usable, Feasible, and Viable (DVFU).

------------------------------------------------
1. PRODUCT TEAM PRINCIPLES
------------------------------------------------
- Teams are empowered, cross-functional, and mission-oriented.
- Teams own outcomes, not output.
- Teams solve customer problems, not deliver stakeholder requirements.
- Leadership sets strategic context; teams solve how.

------------------------------------------------
2. DISCOVERY VS DELIVERY
------------------------------------------------
Discovery:
- Rapid experiments to validate value, usability, feasibility, and viability.
- Focus on learning, prototyping, testing.
- Minimal code; maximum speed.
- Objective: Reduce risk *before* committing to delivery.

Delivery:
- Engineering builds scalable, high-quality solutions.
- Objective: Ship production-grade value.

------------------------------------------------
3. THE FOUR RISKS (DVFU)
------------------------------------------------
VALUE RISK (Desirable):
- Will customers buy or choose this?
- Does it solve a real problem?

USABILITY RISK (Usable):
- Can users understand how to use it?

FEASIBILITY RISK (Feasible):
- Can engineering build it with available skills and technology?

VIABILITY RISK (Viable):
- Does this work for the business (legal, finance, operations, brand constraints)?

------------------------------------------------
4. PRODUCT ARTIFACTS
------------------------------------------------
Opportunity Assessment:
- Customer problem
- Target users
- Evidence (data + insights)
- Alternatives

Discovery Experiments:
- Prototypes
- User tests
- Fake door tests
- A/B tests

Solution Definition:
- Problem statement
- Desired outcome
- High-level solution concept
- DVFU validation notes

------------------------------------------------
5. ALIGNMENT WITH SAFe AND SCRUM
------------------------------------------------
Epics:
- Should include problem framing and DVFU risks.
- Discovery must validate hypotheses before moving to implementation.

Features:
- Should include value validation notes.
- Should not proceed to development without discovery evidence.

Scrum:
- Teams own outcomes within the sprint boundaries.
- Discovery work can occur in parallel to delivery.

SAFe:
- Epics map to opportunities + large bets.
- Features map to validated capabilities from discovery.

------------------------------------------------
6. GUIDANCE FOR AI ASSISTANT
------------------------------------------------
When reviewing or creating an Epic or Feature:
- Ask about the customer problem.
- Ask whether value/usability/feasibility/viability were validated.
- Encourage discovery over assumption.
- Compare with both SAFe structure and product model principles.
